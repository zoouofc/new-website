# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Files Requiring Changes
Certain things are constantly changing. As a results, some changes will require annual updates, the following is where you can currently find them:
#### LandingPage.js
* Update the boolean depending on if the society is actively recruiting
#### Carousel.jsx
* Update the images included in the slide. Typically just for when we have a new council group shot to add.
#### AboutSection.jsx
* Update the constitution by ensuring the most up to date constitution is being imported
#### CouncilInfo.js
* This file contains array of objects for each execs. The names and bio's for each role will need to be updated when new council is elected. In regards to images simply go to the file directory and overwrite the images with the new headshots.
* This file contains array of objects for each commissioner role. Add comm names in for the respective role when new people are recruited. Feel free to add new comm roles altogether by using the same format.
#### EventPage.jsx
* Update the Major Events as needed, whether it be description changes or more event cards
* Update components/EventPosters.jsx to include new posters from the school year

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm start`
* `npm test`
* `npm run build`
* `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
* `npm run lint`
* `npm run lint:fix`

If you're attempting to run this project make sure to first run `npm install`
